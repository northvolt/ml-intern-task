# Machine Learning Intern Task

## Task 1

### Description
Here at Northvolt we are producing a lot of battery cells. During the manufacturing process, the material is inspected for defects. We have cameras taking high-resolution photos of the material and want to use computer vision and machine learning to analyze the images and detect any defects, as any deviations may result in quality degradation or even malfunction of the batteries.

This is a real challenge we are facing at Northvolt and something you could tasked to work on.


### Case study
If you were to tackle this problem, how would you approach it? 

Please define at least one approach and include any source or literature that is relevant to the matter. You will be asked to present and justify your solution.

You do not have to write code, but you should be able to describe how your proposal could be implemented in practice.

For reference and inspiration, hereâ€™s a real prototype solution at Northvolt showcasing a defect detector in real-time:

## Task 2

Open the jupyter notebook and follow the instructions. Good luck!
